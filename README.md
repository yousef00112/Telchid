# Telchid

**Telchid** is a powerful executor designed specifically for the web version of Roblox. It utilizes the method of writing unsigned bytecode into a Roblox core module script to handle execution. This approach is more stable and flexible than most executors that use the same method.

## Features

- **Stability**: More reliable and consistent compared to other executors using similar techniques.
- **Flexibility**: Allows for more control over execution and adaptation to different Roblox environments.
- **Web-based**: Optimized for the web version of Roblox, providing seamless integration with online platforms.

## How It Works

Telchid leverages the power of unsigned bytecode injection. By inserting this bytecode into a core module script within Roblox, it can manage execution with greater precision and fewer errors. This method offers both enhanced stability and versatility, making Telchid a standout executor in its class.

## Why Telchid?

- **More control**: Offers greater flexibility than typical executors, especially for web use.
- **Proven stability**: Reduces crashes and enhances the user experience compared to other solutions.
- **Continuous updates**: Actively maintained to keep up with Roblox's evolving framework.
