# Telchid

**Telchid** is a powerful executor designed specifically for the web version of Roblox. It utilizes the method of writing unsigned bytecode into a Roblox core module script to handle execution. This approach is more stable and flexible than most executors that use the same method.
## How It Works

Telchid leverages the power of unsigned bytecode injection. By inserting this bytecode into a core module script within Roblox, it can manage execution with greater precision and fewer errors. This method offers both enhanced stability and versatility, making Telchid a standout executor in its class.
